## Description
This application allows the user to type and edit their text in this text editor. The application saves their text and for their next use and the user can also install this application. I used multiple new technologies and structures such as webpack, service worker and client/server structure. The challenges I faced where understanding how the service worker works. Also what properties I need to use in the plugins of my webpack file. Caching was also a little difficult to write out Syntax-wise, the base concept however makes sense. 

## Installation
- Clone the repo
- `npm i` 
- `npm run start dev` 

## Usage
- Open liveserver
- Type in the text editor 
- Leave and comeback and your text will still be there!
- You can also install the application.
